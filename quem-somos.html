                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not 
                    simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
                    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a 
                    Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more 
                    obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the 
                    cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem 
                    psum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of 
                    ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem 
                    ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    There are many variations of passages
                     of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
                     have suffered alteration in some form, by injected 
                     humour, or randomised words which don't look even 
                     slightly believable. If you are going to use a
                      passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure 
                      there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the 
                      middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on 
                      the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as 
                      necessary, making this the first true generator on 
                      the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin 
                      words, combined with a handful of model sentence 
                      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks 
                      reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore 
                      always free from repetition, injected humour, or 
                      non-characteristic words etc.
